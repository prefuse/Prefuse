/**
 * <p>The ActivityManager is responsible for scheduling and running timed 
 * activities that perform data processing and animation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The AcivityManager runs in its own separate thread of execution, and
 * one instance is used to schedule activities from any number of currently
 * active visualizations. The class is implemented as a singleton; the single
 * instance of this class is interacted with through static methods. These
 * methods are called by an Activity's run methods, and so are made only
 * package visible here.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Activity instances can be scheduled by using their  
 * {@link prefuse.activity.Activity#run()},
 * {@link prefuse.activity.Activity#runAt(long)}, and 
 * {@link prefuse.activity.Activity#runAfter(Activity)}
 * methods. These will automatically call the
 * appropriate methods with the ActivityManager.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For {@link prefuse.action.Action} instances, one can also register
 * the actions with a {@link prefuse.Visualization} and use the
 * visualizations provided run methods to launch Actions in a
 * convenient fashion. The interface, which is backed by an {@link ActivityMap}
 * instance, also provides a useful level of indirection, allowing actions
 * to be changed dynamically without changes to code in other locations.
 * </p>
